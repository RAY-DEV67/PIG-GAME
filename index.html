      <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
    The rule of this Game is to NOT roll "1" on the dice
    <p>- Each player can keep on Rolling the dice and keep increasing your current score, until you roll the Number 1</p>

      <p>- This will immediately add your current score to your Total Score,  and the next player becomes the active Player</p>
    <h3> HOW TO WIN ?😎</h3>
    <p>A player is declared the winner when he has a Total score of 100.</p>
